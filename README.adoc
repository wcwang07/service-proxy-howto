= Neo4j Graph Query API with Vert.x
:page-permalink: /
:page-github: vertx-howtos/neo4j-graph-api

This document shows how to build a Vert.x application that loads configuration from a YAML file, sets up an HTTP API, and periodically logs service status. The application supports Cypher query execution via Neo4j and integrates configuration-driven behavior.

== What you will build

You will build a Vert.x application that:

* Loads Cypher queries from a `config.yaml` file
* Starts a RESTful endpoint (`/query`) to execute Cypher queries against Neo4j
* Periodically logs available entity-query mappings
* Uses Vert.x config retriever, web router, and periodic timers

== What you need

* Java 11 or higher
* Maven
* A running Neo4j instance
* `src/main/resources/config.yaml` with the appropriate format

== Create a project

Here is the content of the `pom.xml` file you should be using:

[source,xml,role="collapsed"]
.Maven `pom.xml`
----
include::pom.xml[]
----

The project uses:

- `vertx-config` for dynamic configuration loading
- `vertx-web` for routing and REST endpoints
- `jackson-databind` for response serialization
- `neo4j-java-driver` for database access

== Design the Configuration

The application loads a YAML config file with entity-to-Cypher query mappings:

[source,yaml]
----
neo4jQueries:
  entitiesToCypherQueries:
    - entityPair: "Person-Friends"
      query: "MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(f:Person) RETURN p, f"
    - entityPair: "City-LocatedIn"
      query: "MATCH (c:City)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r:Region) RETURN c, r"
----

== Implement the Verticle

The core logic resides in `Neo4jGraphVerticle`:

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/neo4vertx/service/Neo4jGraphVerticle.java[]
----

<1> Loads config using `ConfigRetriever` with a YAML file from the classpath
<2> Extracts and maps `entityPair` to Cypher queries
<3> Starts an HTTP server with `/query` POST endpoint
<4> Logs supported queries every 5 seconds via `vertx.setPeriodic()`
<5> Uses a helper class (`RemoteGraphService`) to execute queries against Neo4j

== Run the application

You can run the application using:

. Your IDE, by running the `main` method in `Neo4jGraphVerticle`, or
. With Maven: `mvn compile exec:java`

Expected output (if everything is configured properly):

----
Starting Neo4j Graph Verticle
Configuration retrieved:
{
  "neo4jQueries": {
    "entitiesToCypherQueries": [...]
  }
}
neo4j service proxy standby...
Supported queries: [Person-Friends, City-LocatedIn]
HTTP server started on http://localhost:8090/
----

== Using the API

You can query the service using `curl`:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Person-Friends",
    "variables": {
      "$name": "Alice"
    }
  }'
----

The service will fetch the Cypher query for `Person-Friends`, substitute variables, and send it to Neo4j.

== Summary

This how-to explained how to:

. Use `ConfigRetriever` to load YAML configuration
. Map configuration to Neo4j queries
. Create an HTTP API in Vert.x using `Router`
. Periodically log service status using `setPeriodic()`
